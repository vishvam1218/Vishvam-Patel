## 📘 Overview

This repository contains my **self-learning Java programs**, written as part of my personal practice and exploration of core Java concepts.  
Each program focuses on a different fundamental area — from basic input/output and data types to control flow and algorithms.

## 📂 Files Included

### 1. `DataTypes.java`
- Demonstrates the use of all **primitive data types** in Java.
- Covers:
  - `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
  - `float`, `double`
  - `char`, `boolean`
- Prints values of each data type to understand their usage and output.

---

### 2. `Basic_Input_Output.java`
- Demonstrates how to **take user input** and display output using `Scanner`.
- Covers:
  - Reading different data types (String, int, double)
  - Using `next()`, `nextLine()`, and handling buffer issues
  - Displaying formatted output

---

### 3. `IfElse.java`
- Demonstrates **decision-making using if-else statements**.
- Covers:
  - Simple, nested, and chained `if-else` logic
  - Conditional flow and comparisons

---

### 4. `SwitchCase.java`
- Converts a numeric day input (1–7) into a **day name**.
- Example:
  - Input: `3` → Output: `Wednesday`
- Demonstrates alternative to multiple `if-else` statements.

---

### 5. `Largest.java`
- Program to find the **largest of three numbers** entered by the user.
- Covers:
  - Conditional comparison
  - Use of relational operators
  - Logical problem-solving in Java

---

### 6. `ForLoop.java`
- Demonstrates **looping structures** using the `for` loop.
- Covers:
  - Iterations, counters, and pattern printing
  - Repetition and flow control

---

### 7. `Sorting.java`
- Demonstrates a **sorting algorithm** implementation (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort).
- Covers:
  - Arrays
  - Comparisons and swaps
  - Algorithmic thinking and time complexity basics

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand Java syntax and structure.
- Learn to use **input/output**, **conditions**, and **loops**.
- Explore **decision-making** and **control flow** statements.
- Implement simple **sorting algorithms** and logic building.
- Build a solid foundation for **advanced Java and DSA**.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Programs

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the `.java` files.
3. Compile any Java file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
